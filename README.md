# crystal-pq
A "crystal-db"-compliant postgres driver

### Requirements

- libpq

### Usage

* Add the following to your `shards.yml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  pq:
    github: abidon/crystal-pq
    branch: master
```

* Open a connection to the database

```crystal
require "db"
require "pq"

DB.open "postgres://localhost:5432/mydb?prepared_statements=false" do |db|
    db.exec "INSERT INTO persons(firstname, lastname) VALUES ($1, $2)", "John", "Doe"
end
```

**Note:** At the moment, only unprepared statements have been implemented, you'll need to add the `?prepared_statements=false` at the end of the connection string to make it work properly.

### Roadmap

* Implement prepared statements
* Support postgres connection string parameters

### Used in...

* [crystal-pq](https://github.com/abidon/crystal-pq): A [crystal-db](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db) compliant postgres driver
